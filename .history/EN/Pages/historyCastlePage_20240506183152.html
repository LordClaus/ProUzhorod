                    <p> The name of the Ungvar castle (castle on the river) also gave the city its name (at the
                        beginning of the 20th century, the name was changed
                        in Slavic
                        Uzhgorod). The first fortifications on Zamkova Gora date back to ancient times, - mentions of
                        Uzhgorod
                        hillfort
                        are found in very ancient documents and chronicles. On the existence of the Hun fortificationg
                        during the transition
                        Magyars at the end of the 9th century. through the Carpathian passes into the Tisza-Danube
                        lowland is also evidenced by the Hungarian one
                        chronicler of the 12th century Anonymous in the chronicle "Gesta Hungarorum" ("Deeds of the
                        Hungarians"): hail over the river
                        was occupied by the Slavic prince Laborets, whose wife was defeated by the Hungarians, and the
                        prince himself
                        fleeing, he was caught on the river and killed, which is why the river got its name - Laborets
                        (now
                        on the territory of Eastern Slovakia, the Uzh River flows into Laborets).
                    </p>
                    <p>Descriptions or images of the fortification at that time have not survived. However, it is known
                        that in the VIII-IX centuries. and
                        especially in the X-XI centuries. fortified hillforts and buildings around them (so-called
                        "castles") were widespread
                        among Western and Eastern Slavs, in particular on the territory of Kyivan Rus.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Some Title</h2>
                    <p>Subheading is also possible</p>
                    <p>The Uzhgorod fortress, as one of the strongholds on the borders of the Kyiv state, had the same
                        features as
                        and other fortifications of the ancient Ukrainian-Russian state, in particular in Prykarpattia.
                        Here, for example,
                        walls, towers, gates, bridges were made of wood. The fortification line of defense consisted of
                        an earthen one
                        a rampart (width - 10-12 m, height - 7-8 m), a ditch (depth - 5-6 m) in front of it, and ended
                        a wooden fence ("grazhda").
                    </p>
                    <p>The power of the stronghold is also evidenced by the fact that in 1086 the hordes of the Polovtsy
                        led by Khan Kutesk never
                        were able to master it... The defenders of the fortress desperately defended themselves during
                        the Golden Horde attack
                        in the spring of 1241, but could not resist the horde - the castle and other buildings of the
                        city were destroyed.
                    </p>
                    <p>After this devastating raid, the construction of a stone fortress began.</p>

                    Already in the documents of 1248, the new castle Ung (Unguivar) is mentioned, which, however, was
                    destroyed in 1326
                    r.</p>
                    <p>The further fate of the castle is closely connected with the history of Uzhhorod. At the
                        beginning of the 14th century he belonged
                        The Uzhan county, the opponent of the Hungarian king Charles Robert, Petar Petenka. After
                        the suppression of the rebellion in 1317 led by Petenka, the castle was handed over five years
                        later
                        to the Italian aristocratic family of French origin, the Drugets, who owned it until the 1690s
                        yr., i.e. more than 360 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 1692, the castle became the property of Count Mykola Bercheny, husband of Christina Druget.
                        Mykola Bercheny, —
                        associate and friend of the leader of the national liberation war of the Hungarian people of
                        1703-1711 against
                        Habsburgs Ferenc II Rakotsi, did a lot to promote cultural life in Uzhhorod.

                            <p>During its existence, the castle was repeatedly subjected to military attacks and
                                assaults. In 1728

                                there was a fire, as a result of which extensive damage was caused to the buildings, in

                        handed over the castle to the Mukachevo Greek Catholic Diocese, which from 1780 housed
                        theological seminary (existed here until 1945).
                    </p>
                    <p>During its existence, the fortress underwent many changes in architecture. Outside, the castle
                        has
                        the view of a powerful defensive structure in the shape of an irregular quadrangle (trapezium),
                        in eachin the corners of which bastions of the old Italian type are placed. This architectural
                        feature is typical for
                        of the late renaissance period.
                    </p>
                    <p>It was in the middle of the 17th century. the architectural, construction and defense development
                        of the fortress was completed, —
                        in this form the castle has been preserved to this day.
                    </p>
                    <p>There were casemates in the dungeons of the fortress. The cellars are the oldest part of the
                        castle, you can follow them here
                        remains of old foundations.
                    </p>
                    <p>The palace has more than 40 rooms. The largest, once knightly, hall is located on
                        on the second floor, solemn events, receptions of guests, meals, etc. took place in it.</p>

                    <p>
                        The castle chapel, the ceiling of which was painted on the theme of religious subjects in 1857,
                        also attracts attention.
                        by the famous academic artist Ferdinand Vydra. Several halls are decorated with stylish
                        ornaments
                        18th — the first half of the 19th century.

                    <p>

                        Until the 18th century the castle was surrounded by a five-tiered garden, planted with rare
                        flowers, bushes and trees.
                        The garden was decorated with statues and fountains.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Since the end of the 1960s, restoration work has been carried out in the castle, as a result of
                        which, to a large extent,
                        preserved or restored emergency, destroyed or lost elements of this attraction

                    <p>

                        Since 1947, the castle has housed the Transcarpathian Museum of Local Lore, a tasting room, and
                        a restaurant.
                        Sometimes knightly tournaments are held.
