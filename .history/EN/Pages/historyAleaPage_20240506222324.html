                    <p>One of the wonders of Transcarpathia, the longest in Europe and the most beautiful linden alley
                        in Uzhgorod attracts
                        travelers from all over the world. I would! After all, this unique monument of garden and park
                        architecture
                        of local importance at any time of the year pleases the eye! The real holiday comes when the
                        beautiful linden trees bloom
                        bloom - and then the intoxicating sweet aroma can be felt throughout the city above the Uzh for
                        the whole summer!
                        Autumn brilliantly paints the alley in orange, sunny and golden colors, and winter transforms it
                        herinto a real white fairy tale.

                        Linden alley in Uzhhorod is 2 km 200 m long, one hectare in area and starts from the former
                        Gubernium, where the linguistic gymnasium is located today. Then it stretches along the river
                        bank
                        Behind two embankments - Nezalezhnosti and Studentska.

                        Czechoslovak architects, building at the beginning of the 20th century. a new neighborhood of
                        Galagov was proposed
                        to place an avenue with trees here, which would please the residents of Uzhhorod, save from the
                        heat, would be beautiful
                        a place of rest and, most importantly, absorbed dust and strengthened the embankment with its
                        roots
                        flood protection. The idea went "with a bang", and in 1928 here, on the former Roshkovich
                        embankment,
                        Czechoslovak biologists planted linden trees for the first time: a total of 300 trees of
                        different varieties - Crimean,
                        American, Canadian and broad-leaved.

                        When does the linden alley bloom in Uzhhorod?
                        The specificity is that each variety blooms for about two weeks and actually one after the
                        other. That's why they are sweet
                        floral scents are felt in Uzhhorod from May to mid-summer. And in the spring on the nearby
                        streets
                        there are still many graceful cherry blossoms blooming here! Especially for this amazing sight
                        of cherry blossoms
                        tourists from almost all over the world come to see. At the same time, magnolias bloom in
                        Uzhgorod,
                        Japanese quince, Florida, Chinese apple trees and other exotic trees and bushes. In a word, from
                        such
                        incredible beauty and aromas can make your head spin!

                        In the warm season, especially on weekends, there is not always a free space on the linden alley
                        shop! The people of Uzhgorod love to just walk along the beautiful alley, go for a ride here
                        bike or go for a brisk run in the morning and evening. In addition, from time to time on linden
                        alleys organize interesting promotions. For example, two years ago, young people painted Lime
                        Avenue in
                        In Uzhgorod, the entire alley is decorated with traditional Transcarpathian patterns, turning
                        the road into a real one
                        embroidery The paint used was unstable, so people admired such a folk artistic masterpiece
                        could literally a month or two.

                        What else is worth seeing near Lypova Alley in Uzhhorod
                        Two more dendrological monuments are located not far from the linden alley - the famous
                        300-year-old
                        the Masaryk ash tree, wrapped in vines, and the so-called "Parterny Square". You can follow
                        along the alley
                        to learn about almost the entire thousand-year past of Uzhgorod. You will see a kind of time
