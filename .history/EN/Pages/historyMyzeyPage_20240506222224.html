                     <p> In the very heart of old Ungvar, on the slope of Castle Hill, not far from Uzhgorod Castle,
                         one of the most unique open-air museums in the country is located - the Transcarpathian People's Museum
                         of architecture and everyday life, or the Old Village museum in Uzhhorod. All his exhibits can be seen under
                         in the open sky: these are the amazing structures of the lowland and mountainous regions of the region: Rusyns-Valleyans, Romania,
                         Hungarians, Boiks and Hutsuls.

                         The history of the museumThe Old Village Museum in Uzhhorod officially began its work at the end of June 1970. For exposure
                         the most characteristic structures for each Transcarpathian ethno-group are selected in the open-air museum (the region for the entire
                         its history was part of 22 (!) states) and transported to Uzhhorod. This is one of the first open-air museums in
                         Ukraine, because before that there was only a similar museum in the city of Pereyaslav-Khmelnytskyi. First his
                         they wanted to build outside the city, near Horyanska Rotunda, but decided on Zamkova
                         mountains Do not be afraid of the past of this area - the area where the open-air museum is located, in the 19th century
                         in. was used as a cemetery and was called "Graveyard". The museum in the city was nicknamed "Old
                         village", because when you get here, you seem to be really transported to a real Transcarpathian village.

                         In general, today in the open-air museum you can see 7 manors, 6 residential premises, a church, a school,
                         kish pantry, valilo (laundry), mill, forge and other masterpieces of national heritage - in total more than 20
                         buildings of various purposes and about 14,000 various exhibits! Each of them has its own
                         a unique, unrepeatable story.

                         Old Village Museum in Uzhhorod: only authentic exhibits
                         The first to appear in the open-air museum was a hut from the village of Guklyve, in the Volovetsky district. At first it was
                         a dusty hut with an open hearth. In the past, the entire peasant family lived in such houses
                         Ruthenians-Valleyans.

                         In the museum you can also see residential buildings built in the XVIII-XX centuries. Impress and surprise
                         Boyki houses from the village of Rekyty, in Mizhhirshchyna, and the village of Gusne, Velikobereznyan district.
                         The latter is known as the "long hut" and belonged to Mykhailo Sverlovych, who, in order to build a house,
                         worked hard in a mine in America. This house was one of the first to be moved to the museum in 1967.

                         Of particular interest is the town house - a real architectural unique! Today is such a type
                         Hutsul closed courtyards with premises for sheep and cattle in Transcarpathia
                         almost not preserved. This is the only architectural Museum "Stare selo" in Uzhhorodian ensemble, in the warehouse
                         which includes a log house and outbuildings. Hutsulska grazhda comes from the village
                         Stebny in Rakhiv Oblast and resembles a small wooden fortress. Such houses belonged to rich Hutsuls,
                         the size of the yard and the luxurious interior speak for themselves.

                         The architecture of the ethnic group of Romanians, who still live in some villages of Transcarpathia today, is represented by a house
                         from the village of Seredne Vodyane (Rakhiv district), and Hungarians - a hut from the village of Vyshkovo in Khust region. One of
                         among the oldest monuments of folk construction is a house transported from the village of Tybava Svalyavskyi

                         exhibits These are ancient household utensils, all kinds of products of folk craftsmen, work tools,
                         festive and everyday clothes and jewelry. The water mill from the village is also very original
                         Kolochava (Mezhgorsk District) and a forge from the village of Dubovoe (Tyachiv District).

                         The museum even has its own folk school â€“ brought from the village of Synevyrska Polyana, Mizhhirsky district.
                         The institution was built in the second half of the 19th century. made of spruce wood using the traditional logging technique.
                         You will see the benches and tables where the children studied, the blackboards on which they wrote, and the old
                         teacher accounts.

                         In the open-air museum, you can visit a real inn from 1860, which was brought here from the village of Verkhnii
                         Bystry of the Mizhhirsky district. There are several rooms inside: the inn itself with a pub,
