                    History
                </h3>

                <article class="blog-post">
                    <h2 class="blog-post-title">Where it all started</h2>
                    <p> Once upon a time, "Lost Uzhhorod" already wrote about the history of the modern pedestrian
                        bridge and its predecessor
                        - the so-called Great Bridge, blown up in the fall of 1944, when Hungarian and German troops
                        were leaving the city. Then we only briefly mentioned the person who designed the new pedestrian
                        crossing
                        bridge and managed the work on its construction. Now we want to tell more about Ivan Shlesinger
                        - he was already too interesting and extraordinary personality.</p>
                    <p>HansSchlesinger was born into the family of German engineer Friedrich Schlesinger. Friedrich was
                        honored
                        honored to receive the Imperial Order of Franz Joseph and personal thanks from the Emperor for
                        being successful
                        drainage works on large marshy areas of Austria-Hungary. In addition to the order that Franz
                        Joseph
                        awarded citizens who distinguished themselves by patriotism, professional success or inventions
                        for the benefit of the fatherland, on January 26, 1907, Friedrich Schlesinger received
                        possession of land in a small
                        to the Slovak village of Černá (the Hungarian name at the time was Ágcsárné, the Slovak name was
                        Černá). According to some
                        according to the data, together with the honorary imperial order, the engineer Friedrich
                        Schlesinger received the title
                        baron, but the descendants have no documentary evidence of that, so they prefer
                        consider it a family legend.</p>
                    <p>
                        Friedrich Schlesinger's son Hans was born in Sarajevo on December 16, 1893. In addition to Hans,
                        there were others in the family
                        three children: a boy and two girls. Unfortunately, nothing is known about Hans' mother, he
                        himself never
                        did not tell the children about her. We only know that the whole family came to small Cherna
                        (even in 1944
                        In 2015, only 468 residents lived in the village, and at the beginning of the last century there
                        could have been even fewer
                        inhabitants) not immediately when Frederick got possession of the land, but in later years.</p>

                <article class="blog-post">
                    <h2 class="blog-post-title">Friedrich Schlesinger</h2>

                    <p>Nothing is known about the school education of Hans, or Janos, as he was called in the times of
                        Austria-Hungary.
                        He studied in Sarajevo, probably received a musical education there (since childhood he played
                        the piano well
                        violins). His first education was military (there is evidence that even before the First World
                        War, Janos
                        graduated from the Vienna Academy of Military Applied Sciences, but his relatives do not know
                        about it
                        confirmed data), and already during the First World War he traveled from Sarajevo in the rank of
                        an officer. IN
                        he participated in the war as a bridge engineer. But he received an engineer's diploma already
                        after the First
                        of the world - when he studied at the Faculty of Civil Engineering of the Budapest Technical
                        University.</p>
                    <p>Apparently, after completing his studies in Budapest, Janos came to live with his parents in
                        Czerna. It is not known how
                        and why, but fate brought the young specialist to Czechoslovakia's Uzhhorod. His family is here
                        bought a house on the then Rakotsi Street (a complex was built in its place during Soviet times
                        "Edelweiss"), another one - on the then Hlyboka Street (now it is Koshytska Street), as well as
                        large allotments
                        lands and vineyards near the airport. It is known that in the building on Rakotsi Street (now
                        Voloshina)
                        Janos's aunt, and later his sisters, also lived there. It was there that the engineer lived as
                        an ardent bachelor
                        up to 42 years old.</p>
                    <p>Once in the mid-30s, Janos decided to go to a store in the center of Uzhhorod to buy new
                        gloves There he saw a beautiful woman whom he liked very much. He did not meet
                        her, did not know who she was. After that, he began to visit that store often, and bought almost
                        all of them
                        gloves, but he didn't meet the woman who fell in his heart there. After some time,
                        managing the construction of Minayska Street (as was the correct name of Janos Schlesinger's
                        position in those
                        times, his descendants do not know), the engineer saw two boys in pretty white suits
                        quietly stole two "cubes" of cobblestones and carried them somewhere. Yanosh went to the
                        neighboring one for small thefts
                        Vuzka Street (it is still located parallel to Shvabska Street) to a solid two-story
                        house, and when he went into the yard to have a conversation with his parents, he saw the same
                        beautiful woman
                        a woman from a shop. It turned out that it was the boys' mother, seven years younger than him,
                        divorced
                        Milada Pacek is a Czech from Moravia.</p>
                    <p>Milada came to Uzhgorod in the 1920s with her first husband, who was a furrier, i.e.
                        a craftsman who works with fur. The couple had their own shop in Uzhgorod, built a house on
                        Vuzka Street
                        street, but family life did not work out, and the couple divorced. Pacek returned to the Czech
                        Republic, and
                        Milada Patskova is an active member of "Sokol" and the Czechoslovak Tu ClubRistiv - remained to
                        live with
                        children in Uzhgorod. The woman was also interested in Janos Schlesinger. One more thing: he was
                        extraordinary
                        kind, intelligent, promising, wealthy, knew all the contemporary elite of Subcarpathian Rus,
                        moreover, he treated Milada's sons from his first marriage very well. In 1935, the couple got
                        married.</p>
                    <p>Friedrich Schlesinger really dreamed of grandchildren, although an astrologer once told him that
                        he would have grandchildren in his lifetime
                        can't wait And so it happened: before the birth of Yanosh's first son, he did not live for
                        several weeks.
                        The little boy was named Friedrich in honor of his grandfather. Looking ahead, let's say that
                        Fridješ, as he was called in the family, suffered from an incurable disease at the time and
                        lived only 20
                        years.</p>
                    <p>Daughter Milada was the second joint child of the Schlesingers. Although her father wanted her to
                        devoted her life to music (the girl successfully played the piano from the age of 5), Milada
                        also became a builder, was awarded the title "Honored Builder of Ukraine".</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, the Schlesingers had a boy, Mykhailo, who in adulthood became one of the most famous
                        of modern Ukrainian scientists, a well-known cybernetician, professor of the Physical and
                        Technical Institute of NTUU
                        "KPI", chief researcher of the International Scientific and Educational Information Center
                        technologies and systems, a recognized specialist in the field of image processing and pattern
                        recognition,
                        in addition, he twice became a laureate of the State Prize (in 1988 – the State Prize of the
                        Ukrainian SSR, and in
                        1997 – State Prize of Ukraine). Mykhailo Ivanovych currently lives in Kyiv and continues to work
                        science.</p>
                    <p>Janos Schlesinger's children say that their father never divided his children into his own and
                        his wife's, he loved and
                        raised them equally, helped Milada's sons from his first marriage to play the violin.
                        When they were rowdy, my mother would send everyone to my father's office on the second floor.
                        Milada Ivanovna
                        now he remembers one of the methods of punishment used by his father. He was laying one of the
                        boys
                        face down on a large drawing board, while another was given a dog whip and ordered to beat his
                        brother
                        with a whip in the place "where the back loses its noble name." Then he changed the brothers.
                        Milada, the youngest, was never beaten in the family, because beating a woman is unacceptable.
                        Her punishment was to stand and
                        to see how brothers are deservedly received.</p>
                    <p>By the way, the office in the building on Vuzkii Street was a special place for Janos
                        Schlesinger.
                        A large drawing board, a bulky arithmetic meter, a variety of drawing tools and
                        measurements, and also a huge library, the decoration of which was a multi-volume German
                        encyclopedia
                        Brockhaus - this is how his children remembered the office of the talented engineer. By the way,
                        back in 1940
                        Janos Schlesinger received a Doctor of Science degree from the Technical University of Budapest.
                        WITH
                        of that event, the family has preserved a commemorative photo in which Janos can be seen with
                        medals on his chest. Now
                        the children cannot say what the awards are, but they testify that Janos Schlesinger was
                        He was repeatedly awarded either for his participation in the First World War or for his
                        professional achievements.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is not known for certain what projects Janos Schlesinger worked on in Subcarpathian Rus.
                        Children
                        they only know that he designed the road from Uzhgorod to Perechyn, Minayska street, other roads
                        and
                        bridges throughout the territory of the region during Czechoslovakia and Hungary. It is not
                        surprising that when in Uzhgorod u
                        In 1944, all the bridges were blown up, the authorities turned to him for advice.
                        Old builders say that Schlesinger in Transcarpathia was for everyone in the first Soviet years
                        a man-legend. He knew well all the designers, engineers and architects of the "old school", a
                        they always respectfully addressed him in Hungarian as "doktor úr", i.e. "Mr. Doctor".</p>
                    <p>And Uzhgorod builders for many years in a row retold the story of how "Fridrichovich"
                        invited together with Soviet and Czech engineers to inspect the blown-up Masarykiv
                        (transport) bridge. It was necessary to calculate the permissible level on the spotloads The
                        young
                        experts armed themselves with arithometers and logarithmic rulers and calculated something for a
                        long time. AND
                        Schlesinger took a notebook and quickly counted everything in his head. When the experts then
                        compared the results,
                        it turned out that the doctor was wrong by only 2 percent, which is quite acceptable in
                        construction. All of them
                        those present were amazed when they looked into the notebook with Schlesinger's notes. They
                        said: well, that's understandable,
                        and it is clear, but what kind of coefficient is this? Schlesinger said simply: this is my
                        coefficient. And explain
                        then refused. After this incident, he was called a genius in the city, who even looked similar
                        on another extraordinary scientist - Einstein. Both always had tousled gray hair,
                        unheard of intelligence and were, according to the conviction of other people, a little strange.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, this did not prevent Ivan Schlesinger (in Soviet times, he mocked the fact that everyone
                        documents suddenly became Ivan Fedorovych) and in the pre- and post-war years he was friends
                        with many
                        famous townspeople. He was friends with Zoltan Sholtes, Desideriy Zador, Petr Sova,
                        Yosyp Bokshai (he even offered Schlesinger to buy a picture from him in which he depicted
                        construction of the brainchild of an engineer – a new pedestrian bridge in Uzhgorod, but the
                        family could not afford
                        to allow the purchase of canvas) and others. Everyone who remembers him will definitely note
                        that
                        somehow Ivan Schlesinger got along in all spheres of life, it was easy to talk about politics
                        with him,
                        art, engineering, literature. He knew German, French, Hungarian and Czech perfectly
                        language, spoke Russian well.</p>

                        summary</h2>
                    <p>As for his unusualness and interesting worldview, these features can be illustrated by several
                        facts Once, already in the times of the USSR, Ivan Shlesinger, who then worked in the design
                        office,
                        sent on a business trip to Rakhov. They did not give money for the trip, and there was almost no
                        money at home. To
                        Rakhova, the engineer, arrived, completed the work, but had no money to return home, so he left
                        Rahova to Uzhgorod on foot. He walked for two weeks, marking himself in every settlement on the
                        way, in order to
                        prove the reasons for your absence at work.</p>
                    <p>Ivan Shlesinger did not become a Doctor of Sciences of the USSR. When he was asked to confirm his
                        academic degree,
                        it turned out that, in addition to a highly specialized exam and an exam on knowledge of a
                        foreign language, the doctor had
                        show excellent knowledge of the history of the VKPB. The engineer flatly refused to take this
                        exam,
                        motivating this by the fact that in 1940, while receiving the degree of Doctor of Sciences in
                        Budapest, he and his colleagues
                        took a traditional oath in which he pledged not to engage in politics. Maybe some similar ones
                        convictions forced Janos Schlesinger to officially renounce in 1943
                        inheritance from his father of the Order of Franz Joseph.</p>
                    <p>The engineer was generally a man of principle. He even won a prize for his most famous pedestrian
                        project
                        bridge in Uzhhorod - he simply gave it to the workers who worked on the construction site. wife
                        at home
                        of course, she was indignant, and her husband explained: this is not a bonus, this is an insult,
                        a penny for this kind of work
                        he will not accept.</p>
                    <p>He considered the light but very strong pedestrian bridge, erected in 1948, to be his own
                        achievement with
                        due to the fact that it had to be built without the required amount of materials and equipment.
                        In fact, he invented a form that required a minimum of materials, and at the same time looked
                        easy and
                        was strong It should also not be forgotten that Ivan Schlesinger was given the goal of building
                        a temporary bridge,
                        so the fact that he has been serving the townspeople with faith and truth for 69 years can be
                        considered quite a merit
                        our local engineering genius.</p>

                    <p>In ancient times, Uzh flowed in the outskirts of the city in several branches that flowed into
                        the Latoritsa River. The currentthe channel is partially artificial, dug back in 1333. In the
                        17th century, the Uzha arm was filled in,
                        which flowed in the direction of Dravtsi-Baranyntsi. Thus, the only main channel remained, which
                        is the river
                        continues even today, Uzhgorod historian, head of the archeology department tells "Novyna".
                        Yosyp Kobal of the Transcarpathian Museum of Local Lore. Of course, repeatedly over the
                        centuries
                        changed its course, and traces of this have been preserved to this day in the topography of the
                        left bank of the city.
                    </p>
                    <p>Uzhhorod arose around Zamkova Hill, which was washed by Uzh and its branches from all sides.
                        Communication with
                        surrounding territories was carried out precisely through bridges. And although the first
                        descriptions of them belong only to
                        17th century, there is no doubt, says the historian, that they existed much earlier: this was
                        required by development
                        trade, the need for communication with different parts of the city or manor lands. IN
                        In 1361, at least two bridges existed in Uzhgorod: a large and a small one. The first of them
                        apparently, history suggests, and was the most ancient. He crossed already at about the place
                        where the pedestrian bridge now stands, and connected the old town on the right bank of the Uzh
                        with the new town
                        (it arose at the end of the 16th - beginning of the 17th century - on the left bank). In 1691,
                        one of the streets on the right bank
                        that's how it was called - Mostova (later Velikomostova), because it led to the big (main)
                        bridge across
                        the Uzh River (now a pedestrian bridge).</p>
                    <p>During floods or when the bridge for some reason had a partially destroyed connection with the
                        banks
                        carried out by ferry or boats. However, it was an extremely dangerous job that did not
                        once ended in tragedy. Already at this time, but obviously earlier, a toll was collected for
                        crossing the bridge
                        duty, explains Yosyp Kobal</p>
                    <p>The customs office stood on the right bank, on Fentsika Square (now Teatralna). While the owners
                        of the city
                        were the Drugets, and then Count Miklós Berčeni, then they were the ones who worried about
                        maintaining the bridge
                        in good condition. Later, in the 18th century, these functions were taken over by the state
                        treasury. Bridges in
                        at that time, they were built of wood, and therefore they often had to be repaired or replaced.
                        In 1785
                        the idea of building a stone bridge arose, but it, as it is called, did not take root. Until
                        1866
                        The treasury collected a toll from everyone who crossed the bridge, regardless of whether it was
                        a local resident or
                        stranger. But since 1866, the bridge toll was removed from the residents of Uzhhorod. And on
                        September 30, 1907, his
                        canceled completely.</p>
                    <p>At the beginning of the 19th century. the wooden bridge was built in such a way that it passed
                        slightly at an angle to the modern and
                        was longer than today. At the same time, temporary bridges appeared - from the end of modern
                        Corzo Street
                        to the so-called Kushnirsky row on the opposite side, where the "Bear Inn" stood. And in 1898
                        the first iron bridge, which had a pedestrian transport purpose, was built with state funds.
                        The bridge was not at all similar to the current one, it resembled a railway bridge - with three
                        huge ones
                        arched metal trusses and two bulls on which the structure was held. It is him
                        the first city bus ran in 1921. This important object of the city existed
                        infrastructure until 1944, when, retreating, the Germans blew it up (as well as other Uzhhorod
                        bridges). The remains of the old bridge can still be seen at the bottom of the river, as well as
                        the supports of wooden bridges of the 19th century.

                    <p>Already in Soviet times, says Uzhhorod historian Serhii Fedaka, the banks of the Uzh were united
                        by a modern bridge.
                        In 2009, it was decorated with lanterns and flowers. And so the bridge was chosen by lovers,
                        decorated with metal locks and hearts. Today it is considered the bridge of lovers. They
                        appeared in the city
                        and traditions related to the bridge. Valentine's Day has been celebrated here for several years
                        in a row.
                    </p>
                    <p>By the way, they wanted to reconstruct the bridge this year. "I planned to completely renew its
                        railings, lights.
                        Such a bridge would fit better into the architecture of the city than this green-yellow one.
                        Kovku was readyperform our forge "Bezykmeister", Serhiy Bezyk shares his plans. He developed it
                        in the spring
                        a computer project, which shows how the bridge will look after the work is completed - a little
                        more
                        lanterns than there are now, and the color scheme is dominated by black with the effect of worn
                        bronze. "I
                        had a meeting with the mayor and the chief architect. I liked the idea, but it turned out that
                        they didn't like it
                        it is necessary... That's why the matter did not progress further," the blacksmith states.</p>
                    <p>Uzhgorod tour guide Vladyslav Tovtin shares with "Noviny" that he was scared as a child:
                        "If you're rude, we'll hand you over to the tar woman sitting on the footbridge." Of course,
                        there was no woman there, but nowadays beggars like to sit there or visiting musicians play. AND
                        Vladyslav tells tourists that once the bridge was the only one in the city. And that in January
                        1919
                        military skirmishes often occurred on it. The fact is that the right bank was in Czech
                        occupation, and the left bank - in Hungarian. It didn't last long (about a month), but the
                        battles between the soldiers
                        were.</p>

                    <p>Of course, the tour guides cannot ignore the strong stone wall, which is visible from both
                        sides of the bridge. The already mentioned historian Yosyp Kobal says that the beginning of its
                        construction belongs to
                        60-70s of the 19th century. This was caused, on the one hand, by the catastrophic consequences
                        of the 1867 flood
                        year, and on the other - by the construction of a railway bridge (now it is a transport bridge
                        on Ankudinova St., and
                        a new railway bridge was built higher up the Uzha river). On the left bank, the wall began to be
                        built in 1868
                        year, and on the right - in 1879. However, the August flood in 1893 swept it away, so it had to
                        be
                        to rebuild. By the way, that part of the stone wall of the right bank, which is located above
                        bridge, was called the Wall of Death. Accidents often happened in this place, and quite a few
                        residents of Uzhhorod met their death here. Suicides who decided to end their lives also went
                        here
                        the stormy waters of the then still full-water Uzh. Today, it is almost impossible to drown
                        here.</p>
