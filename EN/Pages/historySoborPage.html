                     <h2 class="blog-post-title">Where it all started</h2>

                     <p>In the first half of the 17th century. there were huts on this place
                         townspeople The lord of the city Ivan X Druget decided to move to Uzhhorod
                         from Humenny (now Slovakia) Jesuits. On July 31, 1640, he published
                         foundationsWell, the letter about the transfer of the Jesuit college. Cartridge
                         purchased land for the college in Uzhhorod and resettled the townspeople from there, a
                         provided a significant amount of money and land in the vicinity of Humenny and Uzhhorod to support the college. Jesuits
                         received the right to sell wine, beer, vodka, building materials, etc. in the city.
                         Instead, the Jesuit fathers had to pray for Ivan Druget and
                         his descendants The construction of the college began in the same year. After
                         after the death of the patron, the construction was completed by his wife Anna Yakusich. The whole complex included its own
                         college, school and church.
                         In 1773, Pope Clement XIV dissolved the Jesuit order.
                         Austrian ruler Maria Theresa (a monument to her can be seen in
                         park opposite the church) in the buildings of the liquidated Jesuit college placed a residence
                         of the Greek Catholic diocese (1775).
                         Four coats of arms of bishops are placed on the pediment of the residence
                         it was built and renovated by: A. Bachynskyi, V. Popovych, I. Pastelii, Yu. Firtsak. On the first
                         rooms were located on the floor
                         manager of the residence, scribe of the consistory, room for guests and
                         support staff. Four rooms were available
                         bishop, one of which served as a reception desk. On the second floor there was a "pink salon", where a certain
                         Hungarian ones were kept at the time
                         coronation regalia.
                         After the reconstructions carried out on the recommendations of the court architect Franz Anton
                         Hillebrandt (years of life:
                         1719–1797), the residence for a long time remained a separate building, not connected to the cathedral. In 1846
                         Bishop Vasyl Popovych (ruled: 1831–1864) rebuilt the episcopal chambers and provided
                         modern appearance - two towers, an entrance to the gate, a small park with
                         decorative plantings of thuja, boxwood, etc. In the completed
                         the part that connected the residence with the cathedral, on the second floor
                         a new episcopal chapel was built, which was painted by Joseph
                         Boxing
                         From 1949 (after the liquidation of the Greek Catholic Church by the Soviet authorities) in the premises
                         the residence has a Scientific Library
                         Uzhhorod University. The premises have undergone changes: frescoes in
                         the halls were whitewashed, rooms were rebuilt, etc. In 1989, activity
                         of the Greek Catholic diocese was restored, in 1991 the cathedral was returned to it, in 2003
                         negotiations began on the gradual relocation of the university library. In vacated premises
                         capital repairs and restoration works began, which
                         continue to this day. They want to restore the episcopal gardens behind the residence and the cathedral. However, everyone
                         buildings, including a residence (except
                         cathedral), is still the property of the university. It can be changed only by a government decree, therefore
                         repair and restoration measures have no legal basis.
                         The Cathedral of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross of the Lord was built later than the college and the school. First
                         the church was small, with
                         one tower, during the 17th - early 18th centuries. underwent reconstruction as a result of a fire and a storm.
                         In 1775, the church was handed over to the Mukachevo Greek Catholic Diocese and according to the architect's project
                         Hillebrandt was turned into a cathedral. Reconstruction and
                         adaptation to the Greek-Catholic rite was completed in 1779.
                         There were pews, places for canons (on the left and right in front of the altar) and the bishop (on the right).
                         The most significant monument after the transfer of the church is the iconostasis of 1779. Its author is the sculptor Franz
                         Phec.
                         The cathedral is built of brick, its main facade is crowned with a triangular pediment, to which
                         adjoining octagons
                         three-tiered towers with chimes. Initially, the belfries were wooden,
                         in 1812, one of them was destroyed by a storm. For symmetry, the second one was also demolished,
                         and in 1814 the towers were restored. In the left tower is the "Ivan" bell weighing 1 ton,
                         on the right is a 3-ton one.
                         In 1858, the bishop carried out a thorough renovation of the interior
                         V. Popovych. Marble arabesques were applied to the walls, the iconostasis was renewed, and the walls were painted. Bigthe parochial artist Ferdinand Vydra played a role in the renewal of the church. Radical external
                         the changes gave the cathedral a modern appearance, they were carried out under the bishop
                         Ivan Pasteliya. Architectural solution in neoclassical style
                         with the addition of a portico with four Corinthian columns in front of the entrance designed by the architect László
                         Fabri. The work was completed in 1877,
                         the following year, a clock was installed on one of the towers. In 1939
                         the ceiling of the cathedral was decorated with a monumental painting of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross by the artist Yosyp
                         Bokshai, who in 1942 also produced colored stained glass windows on the window in the sacristy.
                         There is a crypt in the dungeons of the cathedral. Here, starting with
                         the foundation of the church, wealthy Catholics were buried. Later, the cathedral became a burial place
                         Greek Catholic bishops,
                         in particular Andrii Bachynskyi, Oleksiy Povchyi, Vasyl Popovych.
                         The last bishop who was buried here was Teodor Romzha, who was killed in 1947. Pope Ivan Paul II
                         2001 during visits to Ukraine
                         proclaimed him Blessed. After the liquidation of the Greek-Catholic
                         diocese, in 1949–1991 the cathedral belonged to the Orthodox.</p>
