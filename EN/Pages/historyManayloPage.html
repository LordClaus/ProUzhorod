                     <p>The Memorial House-Museum of People's Artist of Ukraine Fedor Manayla is a museum institution
                         of the artistic and memorial direction in Uzhgorod, the exposition of which is dedicated to the person and creativity
                         People's Artist of Ukraine, one of the founders of the Transcarpathian school of painting Fedor Manayla
                         (1910-1978). Opened in 1980 as a department of the Transcarpathian Regional Museum of Local History, with
                         Since 2010, it is a branch of the Transcarpathian Regional Art Museum named after Y. Bokshaya.</p><p>After the artist's death in 1978, the idea of creating a memorial museum of the artist arose. It was
                            it was determined that the museum will be located in building No. 74 on Gorky Street in Uzhgorod, where the artist
                            lived thirty years. In 1978-1979, the concept of the museum was thought out, collected and described
                            and registered exhibits, including the artist's personal belongings, archival documents, a large part
                            creative work. On February 6, 1980, Order No. 126 of the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine was issued
                            of the RSSR on the creation of a memorial house-museum of the People's Artist of the Ukrainian SSR Fedor Fedorovych Manail
                            as a department of the Transcarpathian Regional Museum of Local Lore. The first exhibition was located in
                            four rooms with recreated interiors that conveyed the atmosphere in which he lived and worked
                            an artist.</p>
   
                        <p>The first director of the museum was Fedor Manayla's son Ivan, his daughter Kateryna was a researcher.
                            and Fyodor's sister, Olena Fyodorovna Marton, is the supervisor.</p>
   
                        <p>At the beginning of 1981, a re-exposition took place in the museum. Information stands were written,
                            mounted showcases, purchased works of art by the master, which replenished the main fund. To the exposition
                            one more room was added.</p>

                        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Fyodor Manaylo</h2>
                        <p class="blog-post-meta">1910â€“1978</p>
   
                        <p>In 1928-1934 he studied at the higher art and industrial school in Prague. The works of Fedor Fedorovych
                            exhibited at exhibitions of Transcarpathian artists in Europe. In 1937-1945 he taught
                            decorative arts at the Uzhhorod craft school.</p>
   
                        <p>The artistic work of Fedir Manayla in his characteristic rich, original plan,
                            has been unfolding since the second half of the 1930s. Its newly solved, mostly deep for
                            content, expressive works built on the principles of folk art reflected a difficult fate
                            Transcarpathian Ukrainians. During these years, the artist created two of his extremely expressive paintings,
                            executed in tempera: "Plow", as it was exhibited at the Venice Biennale in 1940, and "Bowl
                            with tokan" (corn porridge). In these works, Manayl succeeded, as he himself says,
                            for the first time to convey the Transcarpathian reality of that time in all its undisguised truth.</p>
   
                        <p>Painted with oil, tempera and watercolor. He created paintings in various genres, as well as mosaics for
                            facades and lobbies of clubs, cinemas, restaurants, hotels, camping sites, bus stops. He also worked
                            as a book illustrator - in particular, he designed Ivan Franko's novel "Zakhar Berkut", as well as works
                            Mark Cheremshina, Olga Kobylyanska, collections of folk folklore.</p>
   
                        <p>In his works, Fyodor Fedorovych tried not to reveal an ethnographic flavor, but a peculiar
                            Verkhovyna reality. The innovative style of the artist is a vivid contribution to the visual arts
                            Ukrainian art and places him in the ranks of the best Transcarpathian palette masters. Since 1981
                            the F.F. Manayla Memorial Building-Museum operates in Uzhhorod.</p>
