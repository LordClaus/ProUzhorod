                 <article class="blog-post">
                     <h2 class="blog-post-title">Where it all started</h2>

                     <p>The history of Uzhhorod - one of the most ancient cities in Ukraine and Europe - begins
                         in ancient times. Already in Paleolithic times, the first people lived on the territory of our city -
                         Neanderthals In the period of the early Middle Ages, UZhgorod city was the center of the western
                         part of Transcarpathia, and in the 9th century it turned into a small town. That is, at the time when Kyivska
                         Rus was formed into a powerful state entity of Eastern Europe, Uzhhorod already existed.
                         There is a lot of debate about the origin of the city's name, both in the past and now
                         disputes, however, the final conclusion has not yet been made. Modern onomastics considers
                         the name of the city of Uzhhorod as a Slavic composite derived from the hydronym "Uzh" and the appellation
                         "town" (city). That is, Uzhgorod is a city on the Uzh. Along with this, the Hungarian name was preserved
                         city - Ungvar. "Ung" is the result of the Latin translation of the Slavic "Luzh" (puddle, puddle,
                         swamp, mire). "Var" for our ancestors of the Danube ancestral home had the meaning "store",
                         "protection", "welding in one". "Var" comes from the deity "Varuna", who guards the sky
                         Varu from everything on the left, that is, from evil, from the mythological king Laius (left). However, it is necessary
                         remember the historical fact that the Ugrian tribes had not yet managed to
                         to conquer Transcarpathia and Uzhgorod, which were the most distant southwestern ones
                         fortified points of the Old Russian state, despite the attempt of Prince Laborets to give
                         repulse of the Ugrians, the latter won, killing many warriors and their leader. It is no coincidence that
                         oral folk art calls Laborets a "glorious prince", a defender of his native land.
                         Despite the fact that the entire territory of our region, including Uzhhorod, was captured
                         Hungary, the history of the city recorded the facts when the Old Russian princes returned it to
                         bosom of his state. During the years 1281-1321, Uzhgorod, like a number of other Transcarpathian cities,
                         was part of the Galicia-Volyn principality, headed by Danylo Halytskyi's son
                         Leo - "the most powerful of Danylo's descendants." Only during the reign of Yuriy Lvovych,
                         taking advantage of the weakness of the Galicia-Volyn state, the Hungarians managed to regain
                         Uzhhorod
                         XIV - XVIII centuries - a difficult period in the history of Uzhhorod. Although in 1430 the city
                         received privileges from the king, but continued to remain small in terms of territory and
                         population In 1514, Uzhgorod residents took an active part in the peasant war under the leadership
                         D. Do≈æi, for which the Hungarian government called Uzhgorod a "rebellious city". This one is rebellious
                         Uzhhorod residents discovered the spirit at the end of 1648 and at the beginning of 1649, when they were near the walls
                         Troops of Zaporizhia Cossacks led by Hetman Bohdan appeared at the Uzhgorod Castle
                         Khmelnytskyi. The people of Uzhgorod did not remain aloof during the war of national liberation
                         1703 - 1711 under the leadership of Ferenc Rakoci II. With arrival in 1711 to Uzhhorod
                         Austrian army, the city was looted and plundered, ruined and burned. Only with
                         in the second half of the 18th century, the revival of Uzhhorod begins. Certain influence on
                         the development of the city was accomplished by the reforms of Maria Theresa and her son Joseph II. From political events
                         in the first half of the 19th century, the revolution of 1848 had the greatest impact on Uzhhorod -
                         1849 in Hungary. Uzhhorod residents were impressed by the revolutionary slogans "Down with the monarch!" and
                         "Freedom to the people!", the abolition of serfdom, censorship and the introduction of democratic freedoms.
                         About two thousand residents of Uzhhorod and the surrounding villages joined the ranks of the Nationalists
                         guards Despite the defeat of the revolution, the residents of Uzhhorod achieved Russian recognition
                         (Ukrainian) language as a compulsory subject, the opening of a Russian gymnasium in the city.</p>
                     <p>At the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries, Uzhhorod became famous
                         the European cultural center that gave world culture A. Bachynskyi, I. Bazylovych,
                         I. Pasteliya, V. Dovgovycha, I. Fogorashiya, M. Luchkaya, Yu. Gutsu-Venelina and many others.
                         Many people from Zakarpattia, who at one time graduated from educational institutions in Uzhhorod, taught at
                         the most prestigious universities of Lviv, Kyiv, St. Petersburg, and a number of European countries.
                         For a long time, the "father of Transcarpathian nationalism" lived and worked in Uzhhorod
                         revival" of the 19th century Oleksandr Dukhnovich and the famous teacher, cultural and
                         political figure of the region of our century AvgUstin Voloshyn - the first president of the independent
                         Carpatho-Ukrainian state.
                         On May 8, 1919, the Central Russian People's Council made a decision in Uzhhorod
                         on the accession of Transcarpathia to Czechoslovakia with the rights of autonomy. The fate of the land
                         was decided at the Paris Peace Conference. On November 10, 1919, its members
                         decided to include Transcarpathia in the newly created Czech SSR, and on November 18, I. Breikha was there
                         appointed temporary administrator of the region. Uzhhorod became the capital of Podkarpattia
                         Russia, which greatly influenced the economic development and cultural life of the region. IN
                         "Prosvita" and O. Dukhnovych societies, more than thirty parties, operated in the city. For

                         V. Grenzha-Donskyi, S. Sabol (Zoreslav), Yu. Sheregii and dozens of others. A significant contribution to
                         O. Oles, S. Cherkasenko, O. Olzhych, V. Birchak contributed to the development of the city's education and culture.
                         On October 11, 1938, the first autonomous government was formed in Uzhhorod
                         of Subcarpathian Rus, which was headed by A. Brodiy, but already on October 26, the Transcarpathian prime minister was
                         was arrested as an agent of Hungary and the new cabinet was headed by A. Voloshyn - a Ukrainian leader
                         directly in the country. However, the political situation in Transcarpathia changed dramatically after the decisions
                         of the Vienna Arbitration on November 2, 1938. According to them, in favor of Hungary
